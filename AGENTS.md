# Agent Guidelines

Backend code lives in `/backend`; the React app lives in `/frontend`.

## Testing
- Run backend tests with `npm test` from the repository root.
- Frontend currently has no automated tests.

## Development
- Use `npm run dev` (or `./scripts/dev.sh`) to launch backend and frontend together.
